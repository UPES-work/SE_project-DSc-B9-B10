Visual summary (daily/weekly/monthly).
Categorization (e.g., food, transport, rent).
Smart saving tips and investment suggestions.
Responsive UI for mobile and desktop.

🎯 Target Users / Intended Audience
Individuals managing personal budgets.
Students, freelancers, or professionals.
Small families or budget-conscious users.

📈 SDLC Model Adopted
Waterfall Model:
Requirements → Design → Implementation → Testing → Deployment → Maintenance
Simple and linear, ideal for small-scope projects.

📋 Requirements Gathering & Validation Approach
User interviews and surveys to identify budgeting habits.
Reviewed popular apps like Walnut, YNAB, and Mint.
Created low-fidelity mockups.
Validated feature set through peer review.

🧪 Testing Methods
Manual Testing: Checked UI functionality, responsiveness.
Functional Testing: Verified input validation, saving logic.
Unit Testing (if backend): Tested API endpoints (e.g., POST /add-expense).
Cross-browser Testing: Checked performance in Chrome, Firefox, Edge.
